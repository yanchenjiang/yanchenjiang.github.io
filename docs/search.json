    "text": "Hello! My name is Yanchen Jiang (I also use the name Jeff Jiang).\nI’m a third year Computer Science PhD candidate at Harvard University, advised by Professor David C. Parkes and Professor Yiling Chen. My research interests lies at the intersection of computer science and economics, focusing on mechanism design, incentives, and decision-making. I employ computational frameworks to tackle established problems in economics and mechanism design, and I integrate considerations of incentives, human behavior, game theory, and multi-agent interactions into large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, to enhance their applicability in complex economic environments.\nI obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Harvard College in 2022, with a major (joint concentration) in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor (secondary) in Statistics.\nI have been the Head TA of Harvard’s CS136: Economics and Computation in Fall 2023, and a TA for the same course (CS136) in Fall 2021.\nYou can find more information about current projects I’m working on and prior academic publications on the Publications & Projects page and my contact information. For more information, you can find my CV here."
