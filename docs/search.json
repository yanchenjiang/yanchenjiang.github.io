    "text": "Hello! My name is Yanchen Jiang (I also use the name Jeff Jiang).\nI’m a second year Computer Science PhD candidate at Harvard University, advised by Professor David Parkes and Professor Yiling Chen. My research interests lie in leveraging machine learning to study EconCS, decision-making, and multi-agent AI.\nI obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Harvard College in 2022, with a major (joint concentration) in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor (secondary) in Statistics.\nI have been the Head TA of Harvard’s CS136: Economics and Computation in Fall 2023, and a TA for the same course (CS136) in Fall 2021.\nYou can find more information about current projects I’m working on and prior academic publications on the Publications & Projects page and my contact information."
